# CLAUDE.md

Compact reference for automated agents working on this repository. Humans should
read [`README.md`](README.md) and `docs/` instead; this file is deliberately terse
and duplicates information found there.

## Project shape

- Documentation and demos only. No engine source code exists yet.
- `docs/` — prose specification, ordered 00 through 14.
- `demos/` — standalone HTML, zero dependencies, opened directly in a browser.
  `how-it-works.html` is the illustrated primer; point newcomers there first.
- `verification/` — plain Node scripts, zero dependencies, that check the
  mathematical claims made in `docs/`.
- `tools/build-docs.js` — renders all Markdown to a linked site in `site/`
  (`--watch`, `--serve`). Generated output is gitignored; Markdown is the
  source of truth. It fails the build on dead links and dead heading anchors,
  so run it after editing docs.

## Hard invariants

Violating any of these breaks the design. They are not tunable.

1. The base solid is an **icosahedron**: 20 triangular faces, 12 vertices,
   30 edges. This count is fixed by geometry, not by configuration.
2. There are **exactly 12 pentagonal cells**, one per icosahedron vertex, at
   every subdivision level. Required by Gauss–Bonnet. Total angular defect on
   any closed surface topologically a sphere is 720°.
3. Cells are **vertices of the subdivided icosahedron**, not its faces. The
   triangles are the hierarchy; the hexagons are the playfield.
4. Terrain noise is sampled in **3D world space** from a cell's position or
   direction vector, never from its face-local `(i, j)`. Sampling in face
   coordinates produces visible discontinuities at all 30 face edges.
5. A cell's ID is **computed from position**, never enumerated or stored.
6. The delta store distinguishes *never modified* from *modified to air*. An
   explicit "air" entry is meaningful.
7. Block size is fixed at world creation. Radius absorbs level rounding.
8. Up is `normalize(position)`. There is no global up and no global north — the
   hairy ball theorem forbids one. Never store a heading as a world vector.
9. Direction indices are ordered **counter-clockwise as seen from outside**,
   never derived from `(q, r)` sign. Deriving them from local coordinates leaks
   the middle-child mirror into ~46% of chunks and reverses every rail in them.

## Established results

- Nearest face centroid **is** the containing icosahedron face. Exact, not an
  approximation: face boundaries are the perpendicular bisectors between
  adjacent centroids. Checked on 200,000 random directions, 0 mismatches
  (`lookup.js`).
- `(i, j)` ↔ `path digits + (q, r)` round-trips exactly (`qr.js`).
- A 4-way midpoint triangle split admits **no** continuous edge-adjacent
  traversal. The child adjacency graph is a star; best achievable is 2 of 3
  steps adjacent (`order.js`). Do not attempt a Sierpiński curve on 4-way
  refinement — it requires bisection refinement, which destroys the geodesic
  geometry the hexagons depend on. Plain depth-first ordering is correct and
  sufficient.
- Hexagons in a Goldberg polyhedron are **near-regular, not congruent**. Area
  varies roughly 1.3:1 across the sphere. Do not write code assuming uniform
  cell area.
- The 720° shows up **twice**, and the two forms behave oppositely under
  refinement (`frame.js`). The *geometric* defect at a pentagon shrinks ~4× per
  level (15.69° at L1 → 0.042° at L5); the *combinatorial* deficit is 1 direction
  index = 60° at every level, forever. Raising subdivision depth hides pentagons
  from terrain and walking players, and does **nothing** for rails, pipes or any
  other directional machinery. Do not propose depth as a fix for the second.
- There are **three** local frames, for three jobs, and they must not be
  interconverted casually: axis (coordinates), transported (camera), grid
  (machinery). See `docs/13-gravity-and-orientation.md`.
- Meshing is **not** the disaster doc 11 originally implied (`mesh.js`). Unmerged,
  a hex surface costs 2 verts and 4 tris per cell — a flat 2× a cube surface.
  Run-length merging down a column is exact and free; only the rectangle-growing
  half of greedy meshing has no hex equivalent. Cap merging is bounded by
  curvature (37 m at 0.1 m sag), not by the algorithm.
- LOD is **resampling, not decimation** — Goldberg levels do not nest, so a
  coarse mesh re-evaluates the terrain function rather than dropping cells. LOD
  seams come from terrain sampled at two spacings, not from geometry; skirts one
  coarse cell deep cover them and do not care what level the neighbour chose.

## Naming conventions

| Term | Means |
|---|---|
| `face` | one of the 20 icosahedron faces; 5-bit ID field |
| `path` | quaternary digits selecting a child triangle per level |
| `depth` / `D` | **subdivision** depth — horizontal grid fineness |
| `chunkLevel` / `C` | where the ID is cut into chunk prefix and local part |
| `layer` | radial index, downward from the crust top |
| `crust depth` | how many layers deep the world is; unrelated to `depth` |
| `(i, j)` | lattice coordinates across a whole face |
| `(q, r)` | lattice coordinates within a chunk |
| `cell` | one hexagon (or one of the 12 pentagons) at one layer |
| `chunk` | one triangle at `chunkLevel`, the load/store unit |
| `direction index` | 0–5 (0–4 on a pentagon) into a cell's CCW neighbour ring |
| `holonomy` | rotation a carried heading gains around a closed loop |

`depth` is overloaded in casual speech. In code and docs, always qualify:
`subdivisionDepth` versus `crustDepth`.

## Known gaps

Do not assume these are solved. See [`docs/11-open-topics.md`](docs/11-open-topics.md).

- Floating-point precision at planet scale; floating origin needed — highest
  impact, and both doc 13 and doc 14 depend on the rebasing rule
- Lighting propagation with 8 neighbours and radial sky light
- Six-state block rotation for directional blocks
- Pentagon handling as a *gameplay* problem, not just a maths one
- Player-facing coordinates (latitude / longitude / altitude)
- Rivers, erosion, and plate-scale continents — all global processes
